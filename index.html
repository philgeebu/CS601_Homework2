                <h3>What is Vintko?</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Vintko! I am a curator of vintage Seiko watches and an amateur photographer.</p>
                <p>Up until getting engaged in 2019, I <em>never</em> cared for watches. I had my box full of
                    outfit-matching Kenneth
                    Cole jams with dead batteries, and that was all I needed. During the engagement, my in-laws insisted
                    on
                    gifting me a nice watch as tradition, but I refused because nice watches were a complete waste of
                    money
                    to me.</p>
                <p>While shopping, the wife pulled me into a department store to <q>just pick something.</q> As enticing
                    as
                    the
                    Hugo Boss models were, I went home to do some research before blindly grabbing something. The next
                    12
                    hours
                    pretty-much changed my life. I locked onto #Seiko and scoured Amazon, landing on the green Alpinist.
                    At
                    that point, I was addicted; subreddits, forums, Facebook groups, etc.</p>
                <p>After learning a lot about Seiko, I started connecting dots and wondered if <em>(hoped)</em> the
                    watch my
                    dad wore
                    when I was young was a Seiko. We visited my dad during our honeymoon, and he gifted me a 1984
                    6309-7290 <q>Slim Turtle</q> that he purchased new in Singapore.</p>
                <p>It will forever be a favorite in the collection; it means a lot to me. I also ended up inheriting my
                    late grandfather's watch: another Seiko!</p>
                <p>Obviously, Seiko has a special place with me.</p>
