            <h3>What is Vintko?</h3>
            <img src="img/collection.jpg" alt="A briefcase full of vintage seiko watches">
            <p>Welcome to Vintko! I am a curator of vintage Seiko watches and an amateur photographer.</p>
            <p>Up until getting engaged in 2019, I <em>never</em> cared for watches. I had my box full of outfit-matching Kenneth
                Cole jams with dead batteries, and that was all I needed. During the engagement, my in-laws insisted on
                gifting me a nice watch as tradition, but I refused because nice watches were a complete waste of money
                to me.</p>
            <p>While shopping, the wife pulled me into a department store to <q>just pick something.</q> As enticing as the
                Hugo Boss models were, I went home to do some research before blindly grabbing something. The next 12 hours
                pretty-much changed my life. I locked onto #Seiko and scoured Amazon, landing on the green Alpinist. At
                that point, I was addicted; subreddits, forums, Facebook groups, etc.</p>
            <p>After learning a lot about Seiko, I started connecting dots and wondered if <em>(hoped)</em> the watch my dad wore
                when I was young was a Seiko. We visited my dad during our honeymoon, and he gifted me a 1984
                6309-7290 <q>Slim Turtle</q> that he purchased new in Singapore.</p>
            <p>It will forever be a favorite in the collection; it means a lot to me. I also ended up inheriting my
                late grandfather's watch: another Seiko!</p>
            <p>Obviously, Seiko has a special place with me.</p>
